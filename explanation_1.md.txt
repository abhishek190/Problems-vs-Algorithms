find square root in O(logn) time without using any defined library
The idea is to find the largest integer i whose square is less than or equal to the given number.
The idea is to use Binary Search to solve the problem. The values of i * i is monotonically increasing,
so the problem can be solved using binary search.
Time complexity: O(log n).
The time complexity of binary search is O(log n).
Space Complexity: O(1).
Constant extra space is needed.

# Problems-vs-Algorithms
For this project, I had answered the seven questions laid out in the next sections. The questions cover a variety of topics related to the basic algorithms i had learned in this course. I had write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of my code and my design choices.

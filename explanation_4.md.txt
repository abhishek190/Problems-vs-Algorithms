
At first, the full array is unknown. There are three indices â€“ low, mid and high. Initially, the value of low = mid = 1 and high = N.
If the ith element is 0 then swap the element to the low range, thus shrinking the unknown range.
Similarly, if the element is 1 then keep it as it is but shrink the unknown range.
If the element is 2 then swap it with an element in high range.
time complexity O(n)
space complexity O(1)

the idea is to buld two numbers by alternating picking digits from the array(assuming it is sorted
in ascending order).so the first number is formed by digits in odd position by traversing in reversed
order and second no by traversing in even position and at last return the two no
Time complexity O(nlogn)
space complexity O(n)

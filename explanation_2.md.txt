The idea is to find the pivot point, divide the array in two sub-arrays and call binary search.
The main idea for finding pivot is â€“ for a sorted (in increasing order) and pivoted array, pivot element is the only element for which next element to it is smaller than it.
Using above criteria and binary search methodology we can get pivot element in O(logn) time
Time complexity: O(log n).
The time complexity of binary search is O(log n).
Space Complexity: O(1).
Constant extra space is needed.
